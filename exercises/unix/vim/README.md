`vim` Exercise
==============

1. Install vim (yum install vim on CentOS 6.8)
2. Execute 'vimtutor' command

After completion of all exercises in vimtutor show me the resulting file. Note
that to save the contents of vimtutor buffer you need to execute `:w <file>`
where <file> is a name of the file in which you want to save the buffer.
